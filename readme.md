screeenly is an open source web application which lets users create website screenshots through a simple API.
It's built with [Laravel](http://laravel.com).

The latest version is hosted on [screeenly.com](http://screeenly.com). You can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/screeenly)

☝️ A completely new version of screeenly has recently been released: [https://3.screeenly.com](https://3.screeenly.com).

The app has been rebuilt from the ground up. Its API now can also convert websites into PDFs, return the rendered HTML of a website. This now also works for your own provided HTML code. 
In addition, you can now update a lot more settings; like pixel density or wether images should be loaded.

**The new app requires a paid subscription. The subscription covers server costs and maintenance.**

The open source version of screeenly (this repo right here) which is hosted on [http://screeenly.com](http://screeenly.com) will remain available for the forseeable future. If anything should change and you've registered on screeenly.com, you will receive a notice. 

The repository itself will soon get updates for Laravel 7 and Laravel 8.
